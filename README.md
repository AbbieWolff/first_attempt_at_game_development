# first_attempt_at_game_development

The plan for the game is a 3D role-playing survival and social simulation, probably 3rd person 
with the ability to zoom into 1st person perspective, with a female main character (or at least an option for one). 

I plan to at least begin all of the art, design and programming myself. 
In time, I'll probably bring in some more people to collaborate with 
or to handle a specific aspect (like the programming, if I don't love it or don't have time to do it).
